## 🛠️ Setup & Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm start
```

Runs the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Creates an optimized production build in the `build` folder.

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command builds the project and deploys it to the `gh-pages` branch, making it live at https://tomgalay.github.io/

**Alternative (if needed):**
```bash
npx gh-pages -d build
```

This deploys the `build` folder directly to the `gh-pages` branch.
